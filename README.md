### My Name
My name is Emmanuel Wonsuk Yang. To my friends, I‚Äôm simply Emmanuel. In more formal settings, some call me Mr. Yang or Mr. Wonsuk Yang. I prefer Emmanuel.

The name Emmanuel is given to me during my baptism as a Catholic. Wonsuk, which combines two Chinese words‚Äî‚ÄúWon‚Äù (meaning ‚ÄúEmmanuel‚Äù) and ‚ÄúSuk‚Äù (referring to the stone scapolite)‚Äîholds a special cultural significance for me. Yang is my family name, one that‚Äôs quite common.

In academic publications, you may find my name listed as "Wonsuk Yang." This choice was made early in my career, largely for practical reasons such as spacing constraints in research articles.

While I have since realized that the meaning behind my full name might not be immediately clear to those outside of Chinese culture, I appreciate the opportunity to share its story now.

My name reflects my heritage, and while it may seem simple at first glance, it carries a richness that I am grateful for.

### My Story
I come from a unique cultural background, having spent significant time in both South Korea and Hungary. These two worlds have shaped who I am today.  

In South Korea, during my youth, I was fortunate enough to immerse myself in Theoretical Physics, a field that deeply shaped my intellectual curiosity. In Hungary, I found myself navigating a new linguistic landscape out of necessity, which became an unexpected opportunity for growth.

This dual exposure has made me familiar with both Korean and East-European cultures, yet I often feel like an outsider in both worlds. This sense of not fully belonging has been both a struggle and a blessing, as it fueled my passion for Theoretical Physics and Linguistics‚Äîfields that bridge logic and human connection.  

This sense of being between two worlds sparked a determination to bridge gaps‚Äîwhether through exploring the logic of physics or the beauty of languages. In many ways, the chasm has defined me. It taught me the value of adaptability, empathy, and the beauty of seeing life through multiple lenses. I believe this background allows me to approach problems with a unique perspective‚Äîone shaped by curiosity and a willingness to learn from diverse traditions.  

I share this story not as someone who has all the answers but as someone eager to learn and grow alongside others.

### My Goal
In my early 20s, I dedicated myself to understanding the deeper meanings behind physics equations and published a few papers and patents in computational linguistics. It was an intellectually stimulating period, but one that also taught me the value of collaboration and perseverance.

However, at the age of 26, I was diagnosed with colon cancer‚Äîa diagnosis that would define much of my late 20s.  

The past five years (2019‚Äì2024) have been a relentless fight against this disease. It‚Äôs been a humbling experience, one that has taught me resilience and gratitude. Now, as I rebuild my life as a cancer survivor in my early 30s, I‚Äôve come to realize what truly fulfills me.  

One of the lessons cancer taught me is the importance of pursuing work that brings joy and purpose. While I once found satisfaction in the theoretical explorations of academia, I now gravitate toward coding‚Äîspecifically, diving into large, complex codes. There‚Äôs something about losing myself in the logic and structure of code that helps me find peace and clarity.  
  
My goal as a cancer survivor is simple: to live a life that brings me happiness and allows me to make a positive impact. I hope my story can inspire others to reflect on their own journeys and find the courage to pursue what truly matters to them.

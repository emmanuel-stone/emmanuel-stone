### My Name
My name is Emmanuel Wonsuk Yang. To my friends, I’m simply Emmanuel. In more formal settings, some call me Mr. Yang or Mr. Wonsuk Yang. I prefer Emmanuel.

The name Emmanuel is given to me during my baptism as a Catholic. Wonsuk, which combines two (Korean-)Chinese words: “Won” (meaning “Emmanuel”) and “Suk” (referring to the stone scapolite) — holds a special cultural significance for me. Yang is my family name, one that’s quite common.

In academic publications, you may find my name listed as "Wonsuk Yang." This choice was made early in my career, largely for practical reasons such as spacing constraints in research articles.

While I have since realized that the meaning behind my full name might not be immediately clear to those outside of South Korean culture, I appreciate the opportunity to share its story behind (the name); and I always feel grateful by the support of the listening friends and fellow researchers/engineers.

My name reflects my heritage, and while it may seem simple at first glance, it carries a richness that I am grateful for.
